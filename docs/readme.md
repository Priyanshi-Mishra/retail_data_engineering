This project demonstrates the end-to-end architecture of a Retail Data Engineering Pipeline, designed to ingest, transform, store, and analyze retail datasets using modern data engineering tools and best practices.

It includes data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, validation, orchestration, and aggregation processes suitable for real-world analytics and reporting.

Data Ingestion
Load raw retail datasets (sales, customers, orders).

Data Cleaning
Handle missing values, incorrect types, formatting errors.

Transformation
Create cleaned and enriched versions of datasets.

Data Validation
Apply schema and quality checks.

Data Aggregation
Generate summary reports like daily sales or product-level performance.

Output Storage
Save processed data to output folders or database.
